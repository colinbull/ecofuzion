# What is ecofuzion 

Inspired by 'The Earthshot Prize' which highlighted 15 projects that are repairing our planet. They are, at present, small scale operations with little funding.
Our aim is to source investment to help scale up these, and other similar, projects so that they can make a significant positive impact on our precious planet.

We will work with the eco projects to fully understand how they are working at present and what impact they are currently making. We will then set on creating a vision of how they can be expanded and what impact they expect to have along with detailed costings.

Ecofuzion will then present this information to business and individual investors. Businesses will be able to advertise their support and be seen to be green. In this important decade businesses are aware that they need to be doing everything they can to have a positive impact on the planet. They will be able to announce to the world that they are part of the green revolution.

The invested money will be held in Escro. Ecofuzion will drip feed the money to the projects in 10% installments.  Only once evidence is shown how the money has been used will we release the next 10% of funds.

Many of the projects will be in developing countries so we are there to make sure the money is going to the right place and having the biggest impact.
