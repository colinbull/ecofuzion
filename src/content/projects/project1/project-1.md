summary: "Giant Sequoias are in sharp decline in their native habitat due to climate change, with only 75,000 remaining.
Our mission is to safely plant and protect 100,000 of the species in the UK creating The Great Reserve.  As our planet’s most powerful carbon capture tree we must ensure their survival."

## The giant sequoia

The Giant Sequoia is the world’s largest tree species, as well as the fastest growing conifer.

Famous Sequoias have grown up to 300 feet tall, 36 feet wide, with volumes over 1400 m3, and are known to be as much as 3500 years old.

Our target volume for each Sequoia we plant is 500 m3, equivalent to the UK per capita emissions of 6.5 tonnes per annum over an average life expectancy of 80 years.

## Carbon capture and bio diversity

Ever seen a Giant Sequoia in the bark? Here is an approximate scale illustration of a mature Oak and Giant Sequoia.

A Sequoia Grove can capture as much as 10x more CO2 per acre than a natural UK woodland over the period of 100 years, increasing over time.

Each Sequoia is planted on a 100m2 plot together with 3 native UK species to promote biodiversity.
