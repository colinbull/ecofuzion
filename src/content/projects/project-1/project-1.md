summary: "Giant Sequoias are in sharp decline in their native habitat due to climate change, with only 75,000 remaining.
Our mission is to safely plant and protect 100,000 of the species in the UK creating The Great Reserve.  As our planetâ€™s most powerful carbon capture tree we must ensure their survival."
